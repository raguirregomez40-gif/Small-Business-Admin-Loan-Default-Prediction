# SBA Loan Default Prediction

### 📘 Overview  
This project builds a predictive modeling system to forecast small business loan repayment outcomes using the SBA 7(a) loan dataset. It applies machine learning to identify key borrower and financial features influencing loan default risk.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
Python · pandas · NumPy · seaborn · scikit-learn · Tableau

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Exploration  
- Processed **1.2 million loan records** and handled missing or inconsistent values.  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between borrower attributes and loan outcomes.  
- Visualized correlations and key variables using **seaborn** and **Tableau dashboards**.

### 🤖 Modeling  
- Trained and compared **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **CatBoost** models.  
- Achieved ~**85% accuracy** during validation.  
- Used feature importance to identify top predictors of default, such as **loan amount**, **business age**, and **debt-to-income ratio**.

### 📈 Results & Insights  
- Discovered that higher loan amounts and shorter business operating histories significantly increased default likelihood.  
- Demonstrated how predictive analytics can improve credit risk assessment and support data-driven lending policies.
